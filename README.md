## Scope Cutting

- [ ] Firebase Functions are configured but not implemented.
- [ ] E2E Testing is configured but not covered for whole application.
- [ ] Unit testing is configured with jest but tests are not written for all components in frontend and backend apis.
- [ ] Notifications apis are present in server and UI is present in frontend but integration is not complete.
- [ ] Grievance discussion section is not integrated with backend.
- [ ] UX of Image upload in new grievance creation is very basic.
- [ ] Resend OTP and timeout counter on sign in with firebase is not implemented.
- [ ] Grievance status update by MANAGER/ADMIN is not done.
- [ ] Graph of grievance by category is not implemented with backend.
- [ ] Caching with redis is not implemented in backend.

## Out of Scope

- Aadhar number validation with government aadhar database.
- Securely storing aadhar number.
- Social media integration: In the current version we will be proceeding with mobile number authentication only. Google, Facebook and Other Social Media integrations will be released in upcoming releases.
- Escalation of unresolved issues: In the current version we will be proceeding with the basic flow of registering the grievance and getting the resolution only.The grievance escalation feature will be a part of upcoming releases.
